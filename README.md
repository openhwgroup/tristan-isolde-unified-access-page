<h1 align="center">European Unified RISC-V IP Access Platform</h1>

Welcome to the **European Unified RISC-V IP Access Platform** — a structured and expandable entry point designed to catalogue, document, and promote the IP assets initially developed in various European research projects such as **TRISTAN**, **ISOLDE**, and many others, with a specific focus on **RISC-V**.

This platform consolidates hardware and software components and offers a coherent view of their maturity, usability, licensing, and integration workflows. Beyond serving as a repository index, it represents an **ongoing effort** to address key recommendations from project evaluations.

While not all elements are fully implemented yet, the platform already contributes to several priority objectives, including:

- **Improving visibility and accessibility** by centralising information in a single access point;
- **Strengthening exploitation foundations** by clarifying how IPs relate to project-level strategies;
- **Facilitating interoperability and documentation** through initial workflow descriptions and structured repository information;
- **Aligning practices** with related initiatives beyond TRISTAN, such as **ISOLDE**, **Rigoletto**, and others, to move toward consistent governance and IP management;
- **Supporting internal and external adoption** with clearer structures and integration pathways.

---

Additional features — such as KPI-based adoption monitoring, extended interoperability matrices, reinforced internal tooling adoption, and long-term community-building activities — are planned as part of the platform’s **progressive roadmap**.

The platform acts as a **static unified access page**, pointing to repositories hosted on the **OpenHW Foundation GitHub**, automatically mirrored to a European-hosted **GitLab** instance and to other public forges as applicable, or maintained as private assets. It provides documentation, status information, and an evolving structure designed to better support integration across toolchains, accelerators, and infrastructure components.

Our ambition is to progressively transform this platform into a sustainable, interoperable, and community-oriented resource for the broader **RISC-V ecosystem** — while transparently reflecting the incremental progress being made.
